          <p>this is the first site i&#39;m &quot;building&quot; of 2026. i hesitate to even call it that because everything complex about it that makes it a site was done by someone else. i call it that anyways to reject my own perfectionism.</p>
<p>tilde was chosen as a subdirectory as a reference to the home directory of unix-based systems. the home.</p>
<p>i hope to make this one of mine.</p>

          <h1>What objects ask of us.</h1>
<p>A small object is kind, unassuming. it generally asks little, of our space. a small book tends to ask less of our time. and as a general rule, small things tend to ask less of our money than large ones do. We are constantly in dialogue with the world around us in every aspect of the life we pursue and the decisions we make along the way.</p>

        <div class="md">
          <p>i noticed recently that i tend to be really insecure when it comes to asking questions. it&#39;s something i think i&#39;ve been somewhat aware of for a while but not something that i&#39;ve quite processed much.</p>
<p>it comes from not wanting to mirror behaviors that frustrate me in others. in communities i&#39;ve been in, i notice others that ask questions that can (and really should) have been answered by a quick google. or asking questions in an inefficient and ineffective way that makes helping them frustrating. i worry about not doing my due diligence to an extent that i think it becomes self-sabotage. i want to be curious, to wonder, to understand how to seek understanding of my own accord. i wonder if my worry is being uncertain of the space i can take up in other&#39;s lives. i worry that my worry will only serve to trap me rather than enrich me.</p>
