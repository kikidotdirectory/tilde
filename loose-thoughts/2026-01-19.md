i noticed recently that i tend to be really insecure when it comes to asking questions. it's something i think i've been somewhat aware of for a while but not something that i've quite processed much.

it comes from not wanting to mirror behaviors that frustrate me in others. in communities i've been in, i notice others that ask questions that can (and really should) have been answered by a quick google. or asking questions in an inefficient and ineffective way that makes helping them frustrating. i worry about not doing my due diligence to an extent that i think it becomes self-sabotage. i want to be curious, to wonder, to understand how to seek understanding of my own accord. i wonder if my worry is being uncertain of the space i can take up in other's lives. i worry that my worry will only serve to trap me rather than enrich me.
