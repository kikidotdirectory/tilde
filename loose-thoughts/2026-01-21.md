# What objects ask of us. 

A small object is kind, unassuming. it generally asks little, of our space. a small book tends to ask less of our time. and as a general rule, small things tend to ask less of our money than large ones do. We are constantly in dialogue with the world around us in every aspect of the life we pursue and the decisions we make along the way.
