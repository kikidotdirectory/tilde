some things i want to work on:

- have md or txt files generate a new page for writings
- can macos tags be parsed by cultivate.js?
- accessibility: modify script to allow for control of the DOM from Finder:
e.g. 1_about, 2_now, 2_soon, for logical grouping, then remove those from the title for sighted.
