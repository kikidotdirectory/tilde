this is the first site i'm "building" of 2026. i hesitate to even call it that because everything complex about it that makes it a site was done by someone else. i call it that anyways to reject my own perfectionism.

tilde was chosen as a subdirectory as a reference to the home directory of unix-based systems. the home.

i hope to make this one of mine.
